                    over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by
                    visiting
                    the website of
                    the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine,
                    which
                    displays the same
                    product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online
                    using

                    <h3>Computers</h3>
                    <p>A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
                        arithmetic or logical
                        operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
                        known as programs. These
                        programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete"
                        computer that includes the
                        hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full"
                        operation. This term may
                        also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer
                        network or computer
                        cluster.

                        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
                        special-purpose devices like
                        microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots
                        and computer-aided
                        design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
                        smartphones. Computers power
                        the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>

                    <h3>Smartphones</h3>
                    <p>
                        A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone and computing
                        functions into one unit. They
                        are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive
                        mobile operating systems,
                        which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and
                        multimedia functionality
                        (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice
                        calls and text messaging.
                        Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit
                        (IC) chips, include various
                        sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software (such as a magnetometer,
                        proximity sensors,
                        barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support wireless communications protocols
                        (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
                        or satellite navigation).

                    <p>
                        A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with
                        a screen and
                        alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted
                        on the inside of the
                        upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable
                        keyboard are often
                        marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and
                        thus are suitable for
                        mobile use.[1] They are so named because they can be practically placed on a person's lap when
                        being used. Today,
                        laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web
                        browsing, for personal
                        multimedia, and for general home computer use.

                        As of 2021, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used
                        interchangeably;[2] in other
                        dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. Although the terms notebook computers or
                        notebooks originally
                        referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of
                        the time),[3] the terms
                        have come to mean the same thing and notebook no longer refers to any specific size.

                    <h3>Computer speakers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Computer speakers, or multimedia speakers, are speakers sold for use with computers, although
                        usually capable of other
                        audio uses, e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and
                        consequently require a power
                        source, which may be by a mains power supply often via an AC adapter, batteries, or a USB port.
                        The signal input
                        connector is often a 3.5 mm jack plug (usually color-coded lime green per the PC 99 standard);
                        RCA connectors are
                        sometimes used, and a USB port may supply both signal and power (requiring additional circuitry,
                        and only suitable for
                        use with a computer). Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at all.
                        Most computers have
                        speakers of low power and quality built in; when external speakers are connected they disable
                        the built-in speakers.
                        Altec Lansing claims to have created the computer speaker market in 1990.[1]

                        Computer speakers range widely in quality and in price. Computer speakers sometimes packaged
                        with computer systems are
                        small, plastic, and have mediocre sound quality. Some computer speakers have equalization
                        features such as bass and
                        treble controls. Bluetooth speakers can be connected with a computer by using an Aux jack and
                        compatible adaptor.[2]

                        More sophisticated computer speakers can have a subwoofer unit, to enhance bass output. The
                        larger subwoofer enclosure
                        usually contains the amplifiers for the subwoofer and the left and right speakers.

                        Some computer displays have rather basic speakers built-in. Laptop computers have built-in
                        integrated speakers, usually
                        small and of restricted sound quality to conserve space.
